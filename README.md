## Hybrid Quantum Network Symmetry Learner (HQNSL)
This is HQNSL, a hybrid quantum scheme to learn the stabilizing operators, aka symmetries, 
of many-body quantum systems. Currently under development.

A unit test of the classical deep network is shown in `CNet_unit_test.ipynb` and the simplest
example of a HQNSL scheme is shown in `HQN_1gates.ipynb`. Tests are actively being performed
on the GHZ state, XY-Hamiltonian ground state, generalized cluster states, and eventually more.
